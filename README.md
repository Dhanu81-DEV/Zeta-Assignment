### **E-Commerce QA Assessment — End-to-End Testing Approach**

### **Overview**

This demonstrates a complete QA workflow for a sample e-commerce platform across **Web, Mobile, API, and Performance Testing** domains.Each section reflects real-world reasoning, tool usage, and structured documentation following QA best practices.

**Part 1 — Web Application Testing**
------------------------------------

**Decisions**

*   Focused on **core user flows**: Sign-up, Login, Browse, Add-to-Cart, Checkout.
    
*   Chose **functional + UI + negative + boundary** test coverage for realistic validation.
    
*   Used **Selenium + Faker** to automate and generate synthetic user/product data.
    

**Assumptions**

*   Web app follows a modern SPA pattern (React/Next.js).
    
*   Stable test/staging environment with seeded product data exists.
    
*   Payment gateway is simulated, not live.
    

**Trade-offs**

*   Did not include cross-browser automation due to time constraints.
    
*   Visual regression testing deferred to later phases.
    

**Part 2 — Mobile App Testing**
-------------------------------

**Decisions**

*   Prioritized **device coverage matrix** (Android/iOS + major OS versions).
    
*   Covered **mobile-specific flows**: deep links, offline mode, and push notifications.
    

**Assumptions**

*   The mobile app mirrors the web app’s functional logic.
    
*   Stable backend APIs are already verified via API testing.
    
*   Push notification service provides valid payloads.
    

**Trade-offs**

*   Accessibility testing limited to manual validation (TalkBack/VoiceOver).
    
*   Network throttling simulated in tools, not on physical networks.
    

**Part 3 — API Integration Testing**
------------------------------------

**Decisions**

*   Selected **Postman + Newman** for ease of sharing and CI integration.
    
*   Used **environment variables** for tokens, URLs, and dynamic data.
    
*   Added **schema validation + status + boundary + negative** test cases.
    

**Assumptions**

*   Auth tokens refresh via a valid /auth/login endpoint.
    
*   API follows REST principles with standard HTTP codes.
    
*   JSON schema is stable during the test cycle.
    

**Trade-offs**

*   Focused on functional correctness, not API performance.
    
*   Limited DB-level validation due to environment isolation.
    

**Part 4 — Performance & Load Testing**
---------------------------------------

**Decisions**

*   Used **k6** for scripting and scalability, integrated with **Grafana/Prometheus**.
    
*   Simulated up to **10 000 concurrent users** for the Checkout API.
    
*   Defined clear KPIs (response time, throughput, error %, latency).
    

**Assumptions**

*   Test environment mirrors production scale (database, caching, infra).
    
*   Auth and user sessions pre-seeded before load execution.
    

**Trade-offs**

*   Did not execute endurance tests due to time constraints.
    
*   External network latency not factored; assumes internal load generation.
